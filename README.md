## BirdyMail.me
Temporary, receive-only e-mail address service integrated with Twitter for easy notifications and address management.

## Motivation
Similar services did not provide easy, non-intrusive notifications for new e-mail arrivals. BirdyMail requires minimal effort during sign-up and retrieval.
